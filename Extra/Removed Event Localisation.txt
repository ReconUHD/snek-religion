  snekreligion.17_desc:0 "Recently, one of our head librarians has come to court to request a large sum of bananas to be paid to him. He is only known as the Librarian, and is an orangutan with a brilliant command of the dewey decimal system, but not of the English language. He swung into the palace and angrily demanded "Ook", or else he would "Ook"."

 #Holy site reclaimed: Ulster

  snekreligion.15_desc:0 "We have successfully reclaimed one of the holy sites of the Church of the Victorious Snek. This is no ordinary place however, as Ulster is the place of death of one greatest evils our kind has ever known: St. Patrick; the bane of a once-prosperous realm of our lost brothers in Ireland."
