Its famed corps of civil servants at the White Rose Hall stand ready to serve the nation in all bureaucratic and diplomatic matters. Recently however, a pamphlet in circulation has revealed that the Revenue Agency has more employees than our navy, and decries the former as a waste of money. This has been an acute matter of embarrassment, and has created a dilemma for our [ROOT.Monarch.GetTitle], who has long promoted the vital role of our grand fleet in the defense of our island home. Ships, however, cannot run a nation alone. The sailors will need to be assuaged without compromising the administration. How should we respond to this pamphlet?"

Disgusted, he cast them into the sea, exiling them from their homelands. As a final insult he then came to the Irish, and taught them of the heretic Church of Christ. Millions of Snakes perished, all for the soul of one man. For these crimes, we must take back these lands, and return them to her scaled embrace."
